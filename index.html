I thrive in situations that require problem solving and enjoy the challenge en route to the solution. I currently work as a Technical Recruiter which has really sparked my interest into web development. Prior to being a recruiter, the thought of learning how to become a developer never crossed my mind. I have the luxury of viewing portfolios from developers across the country and that is where I discovered the endless possibilites of web development. I aspire to be a UI/UX developer who delivers clean and crisp web applications. I look forward to this journey and cannot wait to begin my career as a web developer!</p>
